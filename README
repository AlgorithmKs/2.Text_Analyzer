Hi, nice to see you!

This code is for searching words in the passed text.

#To use this code make following steps:

1. To analyze text pass it to the "comment" variable (in the beginning of the code)
2. Set the word to the "word" variable (in the end of the code) and execute the code. 

#How does this code work:

As a result, the passed text will be formatted, a dictionary will be created using functions and a for loop,
iteration will occur and the result will be displayed: it will indicate how many times the search word occurs in the text.
